# NOTICE

This repository is part of the **Venus Cooling Project**, a collection of
independent studies exploring extreme, theoretical, speculative, and sometimes
intentionally impractical ideas related to planetary cooling and engineering.

The **Laser Cooling** project examines whether directed electromagnetic radiation
(lasers) could be used to remove thermal energy from Venus at planetary scale.
It is presented as a physics-based thought experiment, not as a proposal for
construction, deployment, or policy.

The analysis is grounded in established physical principles including radiative
heat transfer, energy conservation, and atmospheric thermodynamics. Optimistic
assumptions are used intentionally to expose lower-bound limits rather than to
claim feasibility.

No claim is made regarding originality of scientific principles, priority over
existing research, or practical viability. Foundational physics and planetary
data belong to the global scientific community and are used here in good faith.

Authorship applies to the **structure, framing, analysis, and presentation** of
this project as an educational and comparative study.

This work is shared openly to encourage scale intuition, critical thinking, and
an honest examination of why precision technologies often fail when applied to
planetary-scale problems.

If you reference or build upon this material, attribution to the project or
repository is appreciated.
