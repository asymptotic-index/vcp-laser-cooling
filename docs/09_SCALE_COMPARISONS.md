# Scale Comparisons
Laser Cooling — Venus Cooling Project

---

## Purpose of This Document

This document provides **scale comparisons** to help visualize the magnitude of
energy and time required for Laser Cooling at planetary scale.

The comparisons mix:
- **Serious reference points** (global energy use, solar flux)
- **Absurd but grounded analogies** (human-scale intuition)

All values are approximate and explicitly illustrative.

## Atmospheric Heat Content Scale

Lower-bound atmospheric heat removal target:

E_atm ≈ 1.6 × 10²⁶ J

(This ignores surface heat, continuous solar input, and greenhouse recycling.)

---

## Comparison to Human Energy Use

Current global human energy consumption:

≈ 6 × 10²⁰ J/year

### Implications

- Removing Venus’s atmospheric heat once requires  
  ≈ **270,000 years** of current global human energy use
- And that heat must be removed **continuously**, not once

---

## Solar Power Comparison

Total solar power intercepted by Venus:

≈ 3.3 × 10¹⁷ W

Even capturing a small fraction:
- Requires planetary-scale collectors
- Does not eliminate incoming heat

Laser Cooling must fight the Sun continuously.

## Power Plant Equivalents

Assume a 1 GW power plant:

- Annual output ≈ 3.15 × 10¹⁶ J

Number of plants needed to remove atmospheric heat once:

≈ **5 billion 1 GW plants**

Operating continuously for a year.

## Human Running Equivalent (Absurd but Grounded)

Assume:
- Average running cost ≈ 1 kcal/kg/km
- 75 kg person → ~75 kcal/km
- 1 kcal ≈ 4,184 J

Energy per kilometer:

E_run ≈ 3.1 × 10⁵ J/km

### Conversion

- Venus atmospheric heat ≈ **5 × 10²⁰ km of running**

That distance is:
- ≈ **50 billion light-years**
- ≈ **4× the diameter of the observable universe**

This is not meant to be practical — only illustrative.

---

## Time Scale Illustration

Assume an optimistic continuous laser system:

- Power: 10 TW
- Continuous operation

Time to remove atmospheric heat once:

≈ **500,000 years**

And incoming solar heat continues during this time.

## Why These Comparisons Matter

Planetary cooling problems fail silently when scale is ignored.
These comparisons exist to make failure obvious.

## Summary

> Laser Cooling fails by orders of magnitude,  
> not by lack of precision.

If the numbers feel unreasonable, the intuition is likely wrong.
