# Energy and Resources
Laser Cooling — Venus Cooling Project

## Purpose of This Document

This document quantifies the **energy and resource requirements** of the Laser
Cooling concept. The objective is to establish **lower-bound energy costs** and
identify where power generation dominates feasibility.

## Thermal Energy Scale of Venus

Venus’s surface and atmosphere store an enormous amount of thermal energy.

A rough lower-bound estimate considers only atmospheric heat content:

E_atm ≈ M · c · ΔT

Where:
- M ≈ 4.8 × 10²⁰ kg (atmospheric mass)
- c ≈ 850 J/kg·K (CO₂ specific heat)
- ΔT ≈ 400 K (order-of-magnitude cooling target)

Result:

E_atm ≈ 1.6 × 10²⁶ J

This ignores:
- Surface heat
- Continuous solar input
- Greenhouse recycling

It is therefore optimistic.

## Continuous Power Requirement

To remove this energy over time T:

P = E / T

Examples:

- Over **1 million years**:
  - P ≈ 5 × 10¹² W (5 TW)

- Over **100,000 years**:
  - P ≈ 5 × 10¹³ W (50 TW)

These values represent **minimum sustained output**, not peak power.

---

## Comparison to Human Energy Use

Current global human power usage:

≈ 18 TW (average)

Laser Cooling requires:
- Comparable or greater power
- Sustained for geological timescales
- Dedicated solely to heat removal

---

## Power Generation Requirements

Potential sources include:
- Solar power (high flux at Venus)
- Nuclear fission or fusion (speculative at scale)

Regardless of source:
- Collection area is vast
- Infrastructure mass dominates system design
- Lasers themselves are a secondary concern

---

## Conversion Efficiency Chain

Laser Cooling involves multiple energy conversions:

1. Energy generation
2. Electrical conversion
3. Laser emission
4. Transmission through atmosphere or space

Even optimistic efficiencies compound losses.

---

## Resource Implications

Even ignoring construction limits, the system requires:
- Planet-scale power infrastructure
- Continuous maintenance
- Long-term stability

These resource demands exceed typical engineering projects.

---

## Key Insight

> Laser Cooling is power-limited, not laser-limited.

The dominant challenge is sustaining sufficient energy flow over immense spans
of time.

---

## Summary

- Required energy removal is enormous
- Power must be sustained continuously
- Infrastructure dominates system complexity

Laser Cooling is constrained primarily by **energy scale**, not technology.
