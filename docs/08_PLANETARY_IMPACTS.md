# Planetary Impacts
Laser Cooling — Venus Cooling Project

## Purpose of This Document

This document evaluates the **planetary-scale consequences** of Laser Cooling,
assuming continuous operation over long durations and optimistic system
performance.

The focus is on global effects, not localized or transient phenomena.

---

## Impact on Planetary Temperature

Even under optimistic assumptions:
- Laser Cooling removes heat slowly relative to Venus’s total heat content
- Incoming solar energy continues unabated
- Greenhouse trapping remains dominant

Result:
- No meaningful reduction in global surface temperature
- Any localized cooling is rapidly re-equilibrated

---

## Impact on Atmospheric Structure

Laser Cooling does not remove atmospheric mass or alter composition.

Consequences:
- Pressure profile remains unchanged
- Scale height remains unchanged
- Greenhouse effect remains intact

Cooling without atmospheric modification has limited impact on Venus.

---

## Impact on Radiative Balance

To alter Venus’s climate, Laser Cooling would need to:
- Export energy faster than it is absorbed and trapped
- Sustain this imbalance over geological timescales

In practice:
- Laser-exported energy is small relative to total radiative flows
- Net balance remains effectively unchanged

---

## Impact on Long-Term Climate Evolution

Venus’s climate evolution is driven by:
- Solar input
- Atmospheric composition
- Long-term geochemical cycles

Laser Cooling does not significantly interact with these drivers.

---

## Secondary Impacts

Potential secondary effects include:
- Localized heating at emission sites
- Minor perturbations in upper atmosphere
- Negligible orbital or rotational effects

None scale to planetary significance.

---

## Comparative Perspective

Compared to other Venus Cooling Project concepts:
- Laser Cooling produces limited direct impact
- Its primary value lies in exposing energy scale limits

---

## Summary

> Laser Cooling alters where energy goes,  
> not how much energy the planet retains.

At planetary scale, Venus remains effectively unchanged.
