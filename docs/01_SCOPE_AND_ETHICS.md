# Scope and Ethics
Laser Cooling — Venus Cooling Project

---

## Purpose of This Document

This document defines the **scope**, **intent**, and **ethical framing** of the
Laser Cooling project. It clarifies what the analysis attempts to evaluate and
what it explicitly does not.

---

## Project Scope

Laser Cooling examines a single core idea:

> Whether directed electromagnetic radiation can remove enough thermal energy
> from Venus to meaningfully cool the planet.

The project focuses on:
- Planetary-scale heat content
- Radiative heat transfer limits
- Energy generation and export constraints
- Order-of-magnitude feasibility

The scope includes optimistic assumptions where useful, clearly labeled as such,
to expose lower-bound physical limits.

---

## Out of Scope

This project does **not**:
- Propose a buildable laser system
- Address political, economic, or governance issues
- Evaluate weaponization or military applications
- Advocate planetary modification

Any resemblance to real-world laser programs is incidental and analytical only.

---

## Ethical Framing

Laser-based planetary intervention raises ethical concerns related to scale,
dual-use technology, and unintended consequences. This project does not attempt
to resolve those concerns, but it adopts the following ethical posture:

- **Non-advocacy:**  
  The project does not argue that Venus should be cooled.

- **Transparency:**  
  All assumptions, limits, and failure modes are documented.

- **Educational intent:**  
  The goal is to build intuition about scale, not to promote action.

- **Respect for science:**  
  Known physics is treated as constraint, not inconvenience.

---

## Dual-Use Awareness

Because lasers are often associated with weapon systems, it is explicitly stated:

- This project does not design weapons
- No targeting or operational guidance is provided
- Energy scales discussed exceed practical weapon systems

---

## Summary

> This project exists to test an idea honestly,  
> not to justify its use.

Ethical clarity is a prerequisite for meaningful analysis at planetary scale.
