# Assumptions
Laser Cooling — Venus Cooling Project

## Purpose of This Document

This document enumerates the **explicit assumptions** used throughout the Laser
Cooling analysis. All conclusions depend on these assumptions remaining valid.

Where assumptions are optimistic, this is intentional and noted.

## Planetary Assumptions

The following baseline properties of Venus are assumed:

- Mean radius: ~6,051 km  
- Surface gravity: ~8.87 m/s²  
- Mean surface temperature: ~737 K  
- Atmospheric mass: ~4.8 × 10²⁰ kg  

These values are treated as constant over the duration of the analysis.

---

## Atmospheric Assumptions

- Atmosphere is dominated by CO₂ (~96.5%)
- Treated as an ideal gas for first-order calculations
- Greenhouse effects remain active unless explicitly countered
- No large-scale atmospheric collapse occurs

Laser Cooling does not modify atmospheric chemistry directly.

---

## Radiative Assumptions

- Thermal radiation follows blackbody or gray-body approximations
- Laser emission is assumed to be perfectly collimated unless stated otherwise
- Reabsorption losses are minimized but not eliminated
- No exotic radiation-matter interactions are assumed

---

## Energy Assumptions

- All energy used by lasers must be generated explicitly
- No free or reactionless energy sources are available
- Perfect conversion efficiency is assumed unless stated otherwise

These assumptions bias results toward feasibility.

---

## Structural Assumptions

- Laser systems are assumed to survive Venusian or orbital environments
- Structural mass and maintenance are ignored
- No limits on system size are imposed

This isolates **physical limits** from engineering feasibility.

---

## Temporal Assumptions

- Systems operate continuously over long durations
- Timescales range from thousands to millions of years
- Short-term cooling is considered negligible

---

## Human and Social Assumptions

Unless explicitly discussed:
- Economics are ignored
- Politics are ignored
- Governance and ethics are external to scope

---

## Summary

> These assumptions remove practical obstacles  
> to expose the true energetic limits of laser-based cooling.

If Laser Cooling fails under these conditions, it cannot succeed under stricter
real-world constraints.
