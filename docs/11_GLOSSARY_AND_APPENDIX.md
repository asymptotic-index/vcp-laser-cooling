# Glossary and Appendix
Laser Cooling — Venus Cooling Project

## Purpose

This document provides a **reader reference guide** for terminology, symbols,
constants, and shorthand used throughout the Laser Cooling repository.

It is intended to:
- Reduce friction for non-specialist readers
- Clarify recurring terms and notation
- Centralize constants and assumptions for easy reference

No new arguments are introduced here.

## Glossary — Core Concepts

### Laser Cooling (Planetary Context)
The use of directed electromagnetic radiation to export thermal energy from a
planetary system. Distinct from atomic or laboratory laser cooling techniques.

---

### Radiative Balance
The equilibrium between incoming energy (primarily solar) and outgoing thermal
radiation. A planet’s long-term temperature is governed by this balance.

---

### Greenhouse Trapping
The process by which atmospheric gases absorb and re-emit infrared radiation,
reducing net energy loss and increasing surface temperature.

---

### Thermal Inertia
The resistance of a system to temperature change due to stored heat energy.
Venus’s atmosphere has extremely high thermal inertia.

---

### Radiative Heat Transfer
Energy transfer via electromagnetic radiation, independent of material contact.

---

### Beam Divergence
The gradual spreading of a laser beam over distance due to diffraction and
imperfections, reducing energy density.

---

### Thermal Blooming
Distortion of a laser beam caused by heating of the surrounding medium, leading
to reduced coherence and efficiency.

---

## Engineering and Systems Terms

### Power Density
The amount of power delivered per unit area, typically measured in W/m².

---

### Continuous Operation
System operation without interruption over extended periods, often required
for planetary-scale effects.

---

### Energy Conversion Chain
The sequence of transformations from raw energy source to final emitted laser
energy, each with associated losses.

If a term appears unclear elsewhere in the repository, it should be clarified
here.
